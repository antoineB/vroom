* TODO make the ressource.cfg get working easily
  change the $OGRE_MEDIA_PATH
* TODO organise the code in a better way
* TODO make a physic prop like a stop panel
** it must resist to a certain force
* TODO make the difference between front wheel and back wheel
* TODO make schemas of axis of the car
* TODO make sure after all dPSaceCollide that the back wheel don't change in Y direction
* TODO understand what is the interest of swaybars
* TODO make a swaybar like to the front wheel Y changing direction not together
* TODO make sure that the sway bar can be implemented in wheel joint instead of wheel body
* TODO correct the fps managing system
  the time to wait between frames is hard coded
* TODO correct the dNormalized4 bug
** DONE the correction seems to work
** the pb come from the car::updateMotor function
** the problem seems happen if dParmaVel is set too high, or maybe if the gap between to dParamVel is too hight
*** look at ODE's code, maybe help
** search in documentation on paramVel and MaxForce for an anwser sa
* TODO there is a little bounce when the car is stoped
** happen only when wheels touching the ground (or other dGeom) 
* TODO  back wheels turn in high speed turn
