* TODO back wheels turn in high speed turn
** TODO make sure after all dPSaceCollide that the back wheel don't change in Y direction
* TODO make the call to dSpacecollid idependent to FPS
* DONE add a graphical spring in wheel
** its length must be 1 in Y, to be Y scaled with ((car.Y) - (wheel.Y))
* TODO correct the ogre materiel bug
* TODO arrange the include order
  the good way is projet header followed by lib header
* TODO change the organisation of collision
** it must be more easiest to understand who collide who
	but not so mess as nearCallBack, maybe reuse DContactType
** for now its elements as its dCollide elements, this must be set up in an xml
	file
** or i don't know
