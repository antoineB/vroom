* TODO organise the code in a better way
* TODO make a physic prop like a stop panel
** it must resist to a certain force
* TODO make the difference between front wheel and back wheel
* TODO make schemas of axis of the car
* TODO make sure after all dPSaceCollide that the back wheel don't change in Y direction
* TODO understand what is the interest of swaybars
* TODO make a swaybar like to the front wheel Y changing direction not together
* TODO make sure that the sway bar can be implemented in wheel joint instead of wheel body
* TODO correct the fps managing system
  the time to wait between frames is hard coded
* TODO correct the dNormalized4 bug
  thris happen when adding two much force/torque/speed
  and maybe because the car go out of 'simulation boundaries'
** DONE the correction seems to work
** the pb come from the car::updateMotor function
** the problem seems happen if dParmaVel is set too high, or maybe if the gap between to dParamVel is too hight
*** look at ODE's code, maybe help
** search in documentation on paramVel and MaxForce for an anwser sa
* TODO there is a little bounce when the car is stoped
** happen only when wheels touching the ground (or other dGeom) 
** see Damping and auto-disable
* TODO back wheels turn in high speed turn
* TODO make a doc about the schema of the main algorithm
  NEED TO BE MORE EXPLAINNED  
* TODO add spring in wheel
* TODO make the door can be closed
* TODO make a mesh bound for the car than suit the graphical view better

use a sphere for the wheels?
use one body for the car dans 5 geoms (+ 2 geoms for the doors) ( 5 = 4 wheel + 1 car)
* TODO make it runnable on Windows
* DONE correct the memory leak
** come from the drawContactPoint function (type.cpp)
